# paren.js

A few summers ago, I had some downtime at my internship. The computers
didn't have any compilers on them, nor did I have any real development
environment. So I wrote a Lisp dialect that runs within Javascript
inside the browser. At the suggestion of a friend of mine, I'm posting
this here. Hopefully someone can learn something from it.

To run it, simply open `index.html` in a Javascript-enabled browser,
and enter your Lisp expression in the text field provided.

For documentation, see [docs.md](docs.md).
